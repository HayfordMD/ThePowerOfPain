primitive feeling - fire - bad

Pain communicates. 
The simple example of pain communcation is when tocuh fire, it hurts, we want to get away of it. 

Pain can communcate in emotions.

The communication between our body and mind is easy to see when someone is angry.  Becoming angry makes us breath less breathing less hightens our fight or flight feelings, the higher functioning parts of our brian that regulate emotions have less oxygen. 

Pain communicates between our body mind and soul. In communication we find relationship. In a relationship with God we find his power. 

Pain in our body. 

Let me hurt him. 

12 And the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your [k]power; only do not lay a hand on his person.”

- physical pain is deep 
Our body hurting plays deeply into us. I am hurting, I am someone who suffers, I am weak, 
The bed ridden beging to believe "I am lazy" 
If you were not in pain - you wouldned be 'lazy'. 
You are a warrior, a hero, by simply wanting the chance and working towards leaving the pain. <--- leave that place


4 So Satan answered the Lord and said, “Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life. 5 But stretch out Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will surely curse You to Your face!”


There are times of acceptance, acceptance of pain is hard. 

Pain in our soul
