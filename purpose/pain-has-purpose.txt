primitive feeling - fire - bad 

Let me hurt him. 

12 And the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your [k]power; only do not lay a hand on his person.”

- physical pain is deep 
Our body hurting plays deeply into us. I am hurting, I am someone who suffers, I am weak, 
The bed ridden beging to believe "I am lazy" 
If you were not in pain - you wouldned be 'lazy'. 
You are a warrior, a hero, by simply wanting the chance and working towards leaving the pain. <--- leave that place
