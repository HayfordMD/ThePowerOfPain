Sharing in Pain 
To love you in sickness and in health

I always believed that being the one how was healthy was harder. It's hard to take care of someone day in and day out. 
They're both super hard. 
It's hard to need help 

the stubborn and useless patient.
our stubbornness can make things worse 

Job's friends see his pain. 

So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.

It's easy to have pain seperate yourself from others. 
1 Peter 4:16 - Pain is nothing something to experiance shame over. We want to hide something that can bring humanity closer to God.


 Jesus experainced all the pain we would, all the humanness, and there is no shame in it. God became man for our salvation. He experianced pain to take away eternal pain, eternal damination.
 
 John 1:14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.
