1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God and [a]shunned evil. 2 And seven sons and three daughters were born to him. 3 Also, his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household, so that this man was the greatest of all the [b]people of the East.

Job's place is UZ - he has a home and is established. He is blameless and upright, he fears God, he has family, he has wealth, 
The start of Job takes those places away, 
His children, his wealth, his stature

Raiders - livestock and wealth - stolen from him

Wind tears down the corners of his home

22 In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong.
 His fear of God slowly drains away over the course of the book. 

Jobs response to pain varies it has ups and downs and shows us - pain moves in different places. It's easy to understand the physical movement of pain. Your feet hurt and you find changing your shoes helps, your new shoes cause pain in your back, you find you're realy proble is in the arch of your foot, which is tightening from excertion in excercise. And you excercise because you are trying not to get fat from eating donuts, when you finally come to the point of understanding that donuts are causing you pain.  You find the soul and spirit crushing pain is you should eat less donuts. Not eating donuts is closely associated with purgatory. 

 Physically within us and our soul and spirit. 

3 After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.

by the end of the book his fear of God is all but Gone.
