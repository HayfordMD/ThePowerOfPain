In this life you will suffer. That's a fun way to start reading. 
Jesus came because we needed a doctor

> "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners." - Mark 2:17

The fall of man came with a true sickness a deprication of the body and physical seperation from God and man - Gods simple and easy walking among man. 

After the fall His radiance was too much for us.

19 Then He said, “I will make all My goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.” 20 But He said, “You cannot see My face; for no man shall see Me, and live.” 21 And the Lord said, “Here is a place by Me, and you shall stand on the rock. 22 So it shall be, while My glory passes by, that I will put you in the cleft of the rock, and will cover you with My hand while I pass by. 23 Then I will take away My hand, and you shall see My back; but My face shall not be seen.”

We know Gods love exists and it's one of the hard questions we face in asking the question of Why would God let this happen? God didn't foresake humans, inevtiable is not the same as planned. He's not letting pain happen we are experiancing the consequence of sin. Pain and Suffering is part of our seperation from him

What can I do because this has happened?
Power of pain - 
We can share with others
We can overcome 

We choose to praise him
