It's an odd thing to write in a public repository a book

To share something that is flawed and WIP. WIth the purpose of making it something honed and refined. 

Interestingly though that's kind of what is done with Code and Git anyway. 

I don't have a strong outline yet. 

I don't have much to put in a readme.
